# A/B Testing For Optimizing Product Page for Higher Conversions

## Problem Definition

VirtuMart Central, a medium-sized online e-commerce business, is currently experiencing a conversion rate of approximately 13% on its product page. The UX design team has developed a new version of the product page to increase this conversion rate. The goal is to achieve an uplift of 2%, raising the conversion rate to 15%. 

The challenge is to determine whether the new design is effective in achieving this uplift. This will be tested through an A/B test, named the “Product Page Conversion Test”, where the performance of the new design (variant B) will be compared against the current design (variant A) in terms of conversion rate. 

The success of the new design will be measured by its ability to achieve or exceed the target conversion rate of 15%.
